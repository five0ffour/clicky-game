## Overview    
The game is an implementation of a memory card game.  The game will shuffle and display twelve cards.  The player chooses a card by clikcing on it.   If that card hasn't been chosen before, the user scores a point. If they've previously chose that card, the game ends.  The game keeps track of high scores and automatically puts the user in a new game.

## Developer notes  
- **.gitignore.** - ubiquitous git file to keep node modules and passwords out of GIT  
- **src/...** - the react application with the starting App.js logic  
- **public/...** - the front end of the app minus handlebars, contains jQuery event logic and the CSS, images, fonts and such
